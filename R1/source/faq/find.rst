Install on FreeBSD

This should work::

or::

  cd /usr/ports/www/varnish6
  make all install clean

Where is the bug I opened in 2012?

We saved a snapshot of the old tickets from 'Trac',
if you remember the number,
`click here <http://r.varnish-cache.org/trac/ticket/1234>`_
and fix up the URL with the ticket number.

We have also created place-holder tickets on Github, so
you can find it by browsing
`closed issues. <https://github.com/varnishcache/varnish-cache/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed>`_
